Take a look at the constants.js file to make network changes.

export const PRECISION = 1000_000;
// Symbol of the network
export const SYMBOL = "TZERO"; 
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "5HEdBfVACfCYaK2YXeoWD2KRmUxxiShgKnK5RgCP149baSUr"; 
export const NETWORK_ENDPOINT = "wss://ws.test.azero.dev";
// this is a test account used for artwork creation for demo
export const mnemonic = "crouch twice begin hub note start reject edit cruel valid lazy stage";
// gaslimit of each transaction
